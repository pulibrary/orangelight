# Patron Groups and Request Options

One needs an Alma account that is active to make requests for library materials except for those that are in our special collections and can be requested directly through the Aeon system. 

We have two groupings of patron types. 

* "core" patrons, patrons who are full-time members of the Princeton Community members who have access to all our request services. 
* "affiliate" and "guest" patrons, patrons who have been sponsored for access to selective services through their local institutions connection to Princeton or by their connection to a full-time member of the Princeton Community. "Guest" patrons have purchased borrowing services from the library.
