1. Remove or update specs related to the guest_patron; delete Factory
2. Review the use of "ask_me" - covid era feature that is not a current service.
3. Review use of the "paging" and "on_shelf" services I believe these are essentially the same thing at this point. There are spects related to both.
4. Review use the "annex_edd" service string, if this is an actual 'service' add to the documentation in the appropriate place. I'm not sure what the distinction here woudl be from the standard "on_shelf_edd" service.
