On the day of her school garage sale, A-young presents her father Taeman Chae, claiming that he is her useful item which is not in use, and JT, who craves for a father figure in his life, takes the offer and rents Taeman. Since then, A-young's puts an advertisement on a website and Taeman's father rental business expands making it official. However, out of shame, Taeman carries on his business without letting his wife, Jisu know about it. Taeman plays an excellent father figure for others who pay for the service, while neglecting his real family due to his busy schedule. Meanwhile, Jisu suspects Taeman's double life and figures he is having an affair with JT's mother, thus making their marriage fall apart. Realizing the crisis upon her family, A-young pays all her savings to rent her own father, Taeman. Taeman and Jisu realizes they have not paid enough attention to their daughter and reclaims their family value once and for all.\"--Korean Movie Database (KMDb)."],"notes_display":["Originally produced as a motion picture in 2013.","2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen."],"credits_notes_display":["Chejak, Kim Hyŏn-ch'ŏl, Kim Yŏng-im ; ch'waryŏng, Yi Chong-yŏl ; p'yŏnjip, Ch'oe Chae-gŭn, Kim So-yŏn ; ŭmak, Kim Tong-uk, Kwŏn Sŏng-yŏn ; wŏnjak, Hong Pu-yong.","제작, 김현철, 김영임 ; 촬영, 이종열 ; 편집, 최재근, 김소연 ; 음악, 김동욱, 권성연 ; 원작, 홍부용."],"target_aud_notes_display":["12-se isang kwallam ka.","12세이상관람가."],"participant_performer_display":["Kim Sang-gyŏng, Mun Chŏng-hŭi, Ch'ae Chŏng-an, Mun Ta-in, Cho Chae-yun, Pang Min-a.","김상경, 문정희, 채정안, 문다인, 조재윤, 방민아."],"language_facet":["Korean"],"language_code_s":["kor"],"subject_display":["Families—Korea (South)—Drama","Fathers—Korea (South)—Drama"],"subject_facet":["Families—Korea (South)—Drama","Fathers—Korea (South)—Drama","Feature films","Fiction films"],"subject_topic_facet":["Families","Korea (South)","Fathers","Korea (South)"],"form_genre_display":["Feature films","Fiction films"],"genre_facet":["Drama"],"related_name_json_1display":["{\"Film director\":[\"Kim, Tŏk-su\",\"김덕수\"],\"Screenwriter\":[\"Kim, Tŏk-su\",\"김덕수\"],\"Actor\":[\"Kim, Sang-gyŏng, 1972-\",\"Mun, Chŏng-hŭi, 1976-\",\"Ch'ae, Chŏng-an, 1977-\",\"Mun, Ta-in\",\"Cho, Chae-yun\",\"Pang, Min-a\",\"김상경, 1972-\",\"문정희, 1976-\",\"채정안, 1977-\",\"문다인\",\"조재윤\",\"방민아\"],\"Film producer\":[\"Kim, Hyŏn-ch'ŏl\",\"Kim, Yŏng-im\",\"김현철\",\"김영임\"],\"Cinematographer\":[\"Yi, Chong-yŏl\",\"이종열\"],\"Film editor\":[\"Ch'oe, Chae-gŭn\",\"Kim So-yŏn\",\"최재근\",\"김소연\"],\"Musical director\":[\"Kim, Tong-uk\",\"Kwŏn Sŏng-yŏn\",\"김동욱\",\"권성연\"],\"Film distributer\":[\"Mega Paksŭ (Chu) P'ŭllŏsŭ Em (Firm)\",\"Redŭ Robŏ (Firm)\",\"메가박스(주)플러스엠 (Firm)\",\"레드로버 (Firm)\"],\"Presenter\":[\"Redŭ Robŏ (Firm)\",\"레드로버 (Firm)\"],\"Production company\":[\"Isŭt'ŭ Sŭk'ai P'illŭm (Firm)\",\"Ŏmyujŭ Ent'ŏt'einmŏnt'ŭ (Firm)\",\"이스트스카이필름 (Firm)\",\"어뮤즈엔터테인먼트 (Firm)\"],\"Publisher\":[\"Tŏ K'ŏnt'ench'ŭ on Midiŏ (Firm)\",\"더컨텐츠온미디어 (Firm)\"]}"],"related_works_display":["Hong, Pu-yong.

Having deployed in early 2012, it is currently in its second year of operation, observing the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). It seeks to probe the as yet undetected odd-parity B-modes of the polarization, which would have been created by the primordial gravitational wave background (GWB) predicted by theories of inflation. The magnitude of the B-mode signal is characterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. ABS features 60 cm cryogenic reflectors in the crossed-Dragone configuration, and a warm, continuously rotating sapphire half-wave plate to modulate the polarization of incoming radiation. The focal plane consists of 480 antenna-coupled transition edge sensor bolometers, arranged in orthogonal pairs for polarization sensitivity, and coupled to feedhorns in a hexagonal array.  In this thesis we describe the ABS instrument in the state in which it is now operating, outline the first season of observations, and characterize the data obtained. Focusing on observations of the primary CMB field during a one month reference period, we detail the algorithms currently used to select the data suitable for making maps. This is the first pass at data cuts and provides a conservative estimate for the sensitivity of ABS to the polarization modes in the sky.

Opinions were gathered on the role of the government in improving the economy, whether corruption existed in local and national government, whether government officials were responsive to problems of the general population, and whether local government officials, the police, the courts, the overall criminal justice system, the National Electoral Commission, and the government broadcasting service could be trusted. Respondents were polled on their knowledge of the government, including the identification of government officials, their level of personal involvement in political, governmental, and community affairs, their participation in national elections, and the inclusiveness of the government. Economic questions addressed the past, present, and future of the country's and the respondents' economic conditions, and respondents' living conditions. Round 5 surveys included special modules on taxation; gender issues; crime, conflict and insecurity; globalization; and social service delivery.

The design was based on a reconstruction of a scorpio done by Bucknell University which based its design on the text of the Roman architect, Vitruvius. Once constructed, the scorpio was determined to have a linear relationship between its draw distance and its draw force with a slope of 1389 N/m and the theoretical muzzle velocity was determined to be 55.0 m/s. The average experimental velocity was determined from accelerometer data to be 24 m/s. The eﬃciency of the scorpio was determined to be 19.1%. The maximum range given the launch angle and the experimental velocity was calculated to be 57.9 meters. The actual distance that the bolt traveled was determined to be 54.7 meters.

Thus, olfactory and motor dysfunction may share the same molecular\r\nsubstrate. Of particular interest are reports that deficient olfaction (the sense of smell)\r\npredates the motor dysfunction that characterizes PD by several years and even has a\r\ngreater incidence in PD patients than motor symptoms. Furthermore, the OB is an\r\ninduction site for the proteopathy that infiltrates the motor complex and cortical\r\nregions in later stages of the disease. Despite the prevalence and precedence of\r\nolfactory dysfunction over motor dysfunction, however, there has been a myopic\r\nfocus on the latter, especially with respect to the treatment of motor symptoms by\r\nblockade of the A\\(_{2A}\\)R. Moreover, antagonism of the receptor has also been shown to\r\nprevent the loss of neurons in the motor complex and may even reduce the risk for\r\nPD.\r\nStill it is not known whether conditional inactivation of the A\\(_{2A}\\)R in the OB\r\nwould recover olfactory function in a model of PD. Additionally, the potential\r\nimpact of such inactivation on the progression of alpha-synuclein pathology in an\r\nanimal model of PD is as enigmatic. We review the pathophysiological basis of\r\nmotor dysfunction in PD, the capacity of caffeine to prevent and treat PD, and the \r\n3\r\ncomplex intersection of PD, olfaction, and the A\\(_{2A}\\)R. We also propose an\r\nexperimental strategy; specifically, for the analysis of olfactory sensitivity and\r\ndiscrimination in non-transgenic, wild-type, mice that will be given an intrabulbar\r\ninjection of misfolded alpha-synuclein and then undergo conditional inactivation of\r\nthe A\\(_{2A}\\)R in the OB priorly.\r\nThe methodological approach we describe includes immunohistochemistry\r\nand behavioral assays for olfaction, the results of which may lay the foundation for\r\nfuture investigation of the role of the A\\(_{2A}\\)R in olfactory dysfunction in PD and in the\r\nprogression of the proteopathy manifest in PD. The ultimate goals of the proposed\r\nresearch are to clarify the extent to which inactivation of the A\\(_{2A}\\)R may delay the\r\nonset or progression of PD and to elucidate the cryptic pathophysiology of olfactory\r\ndysfunction in PD as well as a large, albeit select, group of neurodegenerative\r\ndisorders of the brain."],"access_facet":"Online","location_code_s":"elf1","advanced_location_s":["elf1","Online"],"holdings_1display":"{\"thesis\":{\"location\":\"Online\",\"library\":\"Online\",\"location_code\":\"elf1\",\"call_number\":\"AC102\",\"call_number_browse\":\"AC102\",\"dspace\":true}}","class_year_s":["2015"],"pub_date_start_sort":["2015"],"pub_date_end_sort":["2015"],"format":"Senior Thesis"},
