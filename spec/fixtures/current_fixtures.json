            "A Roman scorpio, a small bolt throwing catapult, was constructed and \ufb01eld tested. The design was based on a reconstruction of a scorpio done by Bucknell University which based its design on the text of the Roman architect, Vitruvius. Once constructed, the scorpio was determined to have a linear relationship between its draw distance and its draw force with a slope of 1389 N/m and the theoretical muzzle velocity was determined to be 55.0 m/s. The average experimental velocity was determined from accelerometer data to be 24 m/s. The e\ufb03ciency of the scorpio was determined to be 19.1%. The maximum range given the launch angle and the experimental velocity was calculated to be 57.9 meters. The actual distance that the bolt traveled was determined to be 54.7 meters. The scorpio was determined to be an e\ufb00ective weapon, able to engage enemy forces over 50 meters away."

            "Hyposmia and anosmia (the partial or complete loss of the sense of smell,\r\nrespectively) is widespread in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including\r\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD), the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder.\r\nThere is specific expression of the G protein-coupled receptor, the adenosine A\\(_{2A}\\)\r\nreceptor (A\\(_{2A}\\)R), in the striatum, a region of the brain that supports the control of\r\nmovement and in the olfactory bulb (OB), the first relay station in the olfactory\r\nsystem. Thus, olfactory and motor dysfunction may share the same molecular\r\nsubstrate. Of particular interest are reports that deficient olfaction (the sense of smell)\r\npredates the motor dysfunction that characterizes PD by several years and even has a\r\ngreater incidence in PD patients than motor symptoms. Furthermore, the OB is an\r\ninduction site for the proteopathy that infiltrates the motor complex and cortical\r\nregions in later stages of the disease. Despite the prevalence and precedence of\r\nolfactory dysfunction over motor dysfunction, however, there has been a myopic\r\nfocus on the latter, especially with respect to the treatment of motor symptoms by\r\nblockade of the A\\(_{2A}\\)R. Moreover, antagonism of the receptor has also been shown to\r\nprevent the loss of neurons in the motor complex and may even reduce the risk for\r\nPD.\r\nStill it is not known whether conditional inactivation of the A\\(_{2A}\\)R in the OB\r\nwould recover olfactory function in a model of PD. Additionally, the potential\r\nimpact of such inactivation on the progression of alpha-synuclein pathology in an\r\nanimal model of PD is as enigmatic. We review the pathophysiological basis of\r\nmotor dysfunction in PD, the capacity of caffeine to prevent and treat PD, and the \r\n3\r\ncomplex intersection of PD, olfaction, and the A\\(_{2A}\\)R. We also propose an\r\nexperimental strategy; specifically, for the analysis of olfactory sensitivity and\r\ndiscrimination in non-transgenic, wild-type, mice that will be given an intrabulbar\r\ninjection of misfolded alpha-synuclein and then undergo conditional inactivation of\r\nthe A\\(_{2A}\\)R in the OB priorly.\r\nThe methodological approach we describe includes immunohistochemistry\r\nand behavioral assays for olfaction, the results of which may lay the foundation for\r\nfuture investigation of the role of the A\\(_{2A}\\)R in olfactory dysfunction in PD and in the\r\nprogression of the proteopathy manifest in PD. The ultimate goals of the proposed\r\nresearch are to clarify the extent to which inactivation of the A\\(_{2A}\\)R may delay the\r\nonset or progression of PD and to elucidate the cryptic pathophysiology of olfactory\r\ndysfunction in PD as well as a large, albeit select, group of neurodegenerative\r\ndisorders of the brain."

She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84 --\u201cQ is for 'question mark.' A world that bears a question.\" Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled. As Aomame's and Tengo's narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector. A love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell's--1Q84 is Haruki Murakami's most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers.

            "The Afrobarometer project was designed to collect and disseminate information regarding Africans' views on democracy, governance, economic reform, civil society, and quality of life. This particular survey was concerned with the attitudes and opinions of the citizens of Benin. Respondents in a face-to-face interview were asked to rate their president and the president's administration in overall performance, to state the most important issues facing their nation, and to evaluate the effectiveness of certain continental and international institutions. Opinions were gathered on the role of the government in improving the economy, whether corruption existed in local and national government, whether government officials were responsive to problems of the general population, and whether local government officials, the police, the courts, the overall criminal justice system, the National Electoral Commission, and the government broadcasting service could be trusted. Respondents were polled on their knowledge of the government, including the identification of government officials, their level of personal involvement in political, governmental, and community affairs, their participation in national elections, and the inclusiveness of the government. Economic questions addressed the past, present, and future of the country's and the respondents' economic conditions, and respondents' living conditions. Round 5 surveys included special modules on taxation; gender issues; crime, conflict and insecurity; globalization; and social service delivery. Background variables include age, gender, ethnicity, education, religious affiliation and participation, political party affiliation, language spoken most at home, whether the respondent was the head of household, current and past employment status, whether a close friend or relative had died from AIDS, and language used in interview. In addition, the interviewer's gender, race, and education level is provided. Cf.: http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR35465",

Meanwhile, Jisu suspects Taeman's double life and figures he is having an affair with JT's mother, thus making their marriage fall apart. Realizing the crisis upon her family, A-young pays all her savings to rent her own father, Taeman. Taeman and Jisu realizes they have not paid enough attention to their daughter and reclaims their family value once and for all.\"--Korean Movie Database (KMDb)."

            "The Atacama B-Mode Search (ABS) is a 145 GHz polarimeter located at a high altitude site on Cerro Toco, in the Andes of northern Chile. Having deployed in early 2012, it is currently in its second year of operation, observing the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). It seeks to probe the as yet undetected odd-parity B-modes of the polarization, which would have been created by the primordial gravitational wave background (GWB) predicted by theories of inflation. The magnitude of the B-mode signal is characterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. ABS features 60 cm cryogenic reflectors in the crossed-Dragone configuration, and a warm, continuously rotating sapphire half-wave plate to modulate the polarization of incoming radiation. The focal plane consists of 480 antenna-coupled transition edge sensor bolometers, arranged in orthogonal pairs for polarization sensitivity, and coupled to feedhorns in a hexagonal array. In this thesis we describe the ABS instrument in the state in which it is now operating, outline the first season of observations, and characterize the data obtained. Focusing on observations of the primary CMB field during a one month reference period, we detail the algorithms currently used to select the data suitable for making maps. This is the first pass at data cuts and provides a conservative estimate for the sensitivity of ABS to the polarization modes in the sky. We project that with one year total observation time of the primary CMB field, ABS should be able to detect the B-mode signal at roughly the level of r = 0.03.",

            "This dissertation provides an in-depth account of the final published monograph of Ernst Kurth (1866-1946), Musikpsychologie (1931), togehter with discussion of its larger music theoretical, music psychological, and philosophical\n      context, and its critical reception. Kurth is best known to Anglo-American audiences for three influential publications written between 1917 and 1925. In them, he presents analyses of the music of Bach, Wagner, and Bruckner that are as ambitious in\n      scope as they are idiosyncratic. Rather than a pre\u0301cis of his earlier writings, Musikpsychologie offers an original theory of music-as-experienced-- one that Kurth envisions as centrally located within the wider disciplinary network of\n      Musicwissenschaft. Part One of the dissertation outlines foundational aspects of Kurth's theory. Drawing on letters and contemporaneous reviews of Musikpsychologie, as well as Kurth's own references to secondary sources, it focuses on the\n      psychological principles and philosophies that inform his study. The project evaluates Kurth's attempts to distinguish his work from other approaches to music and the mind, notably those of the \"tone psychologists\" (including Carl\n      Stumpf) and Hugo Riemann's theory of Tonvorstellungen. It illuminates Kurth's concern for \"musical forces\" and metaphysical language.In his estimation, analogies between music and the observable world are inevitable yet limited in\n      their ability to clarify the listening experience. Within the context of the above foundations, Part Two of the dissertation examine's Kurth's system of harmony as it appears in Musikpsychologie. This system is approached from three\n      perspectives and three questions: a) chordal fusion, or how it is that we sense simultaneous tones as harmonious ; b) chordal tension, or why we feel tension when hearing simultaneous tones; and c) chordal movement, or what underlying principles\n      govern our responses to the succession of chords. Many of the ideas presented in 1931 are found in germinal form in Kurth's habilitation thesis, Die Voraussetzungen der theoretischen Harmonik (1913). This study underscores points of connection\n      between these two works and moreover, the evolution of Kurth's thinking. The final chapter considers issues of form and rhythm in Musikpsychologie, setting the course for further research.

Astonishing on their own terms, now restored and released for the first time, Eight films by Jean Rouch is essential for anyone interested in better understanding the development of ethnography and the cross-currents of colonialism and post-colonial social change in Africa, as well as documentary film practice, film history, and world cinema as a whole.
