        "This book provides a practical set of guidelines for people wishing to communicate and do business in Brazil. Good communication requires more than knowing the language. Orlando Kelm and David Victor, seasoned cross-cultural trainers for businesspeople, provide a guide through Victor's LESCANT model (Language, Environment, Social Organization, Context, Authority, Nonverbal, and Time). Each chapter addresses one of these topics and demonstrates how to evaluate the difference in Brazil, presenting examples to help people avoid common communication mistakes. The book is generously peppered with photographs to provide visual examples. Kelm and Victor complete the book with a chapter of case studies--good and bad. They then gathered comments from various US professionals working in Brazil and Brazilians working with US professionals about the interactions in the case, providing helpful observations about the situation. The book straddles some language and communication topics, international relations, and reaches into the business community."
