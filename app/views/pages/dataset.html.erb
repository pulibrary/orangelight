  <h1 class="page-heading">PUL Open Dataset</h1>
  <p>Princeton University Library (PUL) is committed to sharing its catalog metadata in order to further research and facilitate discovery. This dataset is not a complete representation of PULâ€™s resources. Some records are excluded because they were supplied by vendors as part of the acquisitions process, or they belong to our ReCAP partner libraries (Harvard Library, New York Public Library and Columbia University).</p>

  <h2>Bibliographic Dataset</h2>
  <p>This dataset includes a variety of materials held by PUL (books, journals, special collections, and more) represented by records in <a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/umb/">MARC format</a>. These records were created over time, and in accordance with different cataloging standards, so variations in the records are present.
