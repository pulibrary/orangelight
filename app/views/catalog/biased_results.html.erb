  Princeton University Library aims to describe materials in a manner that is respectful to all individuals and
  communities. However, for a variety of reasons, users may encounter offensive or harmful language—for
  example, language that is racist, sexist, or homophobic—in our catalog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Staff are currently implementing practices to address offensive or harmful language, particularly in subject
  headings. We recognize that terminology evolves over time and that efforts to create respectful and inclusive
  descriptions and subject headings must be ongoing. You can help us address this issue by reporting any harmful
  or offensive language you encounter on this site by using the form below. If you would prefer to report
  anonymously, you may leave the name and email fields blank.
